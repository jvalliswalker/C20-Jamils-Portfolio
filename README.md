# C20: Jamil's Portfolio (2.0)

In this assignment, I create a personal portfolio site using React as the primary library. This site was designed with a mobile-first approach, and uses a front-end react server for site routing. Bootstrap was the primary css framework used, although custom modifications were made where needed.

## Application

You can visit this web app by [clicking here](https://jamils-portfolio.netlify.app/). Below are screenshots of the application at various media sizes.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Mobile View</th>
    <th>Tablet View</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td width="29.7%" align="center">
        <img src="./public/images/screenshot-mobile.png">
    </td>
    <td >
        <img src="./public/images/screenshot-tablet.png" />
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th colspan="2">Desktop View</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td colspan="2">
        <img src="./public/images/screenshot-desktop.png">
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
